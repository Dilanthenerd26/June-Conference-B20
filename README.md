Reminder Scheduler

A simple Python-based reminder system that supports multiple scheduled tasks with up to 3 reminders, spaced evenly. Designed for testing and educational use.
 Features:
Define multiple tasks with individual start times
Each task receives 3 reminders, spaced 5 seconds apart (in test mode)
User can press ENTER to mark a task as complete
All future reminders for completed tasks are cancelled
Non-blocking input using threading ensures smooth reminder delivery

How It Works:
Tasks are created with start times staggered by a few seconds.
Each task gets 3 reminders (default: 5 seconds apart).
When a reminder is triggered, you're prompted to press ENTER.
If you do, the task is marked complete and all future reminders are cancelled.
If you donâ€™t, the next reminder still comes later.
